# Family Self-Sufficiency Data Resources
This repository has been created as a way to share resources for program administrators and researchers looking to use data for family
self-sufficiency research.

## About the Family Self-Sufficiency Data Center
The Family Self-Sufficiency Data Center (FSSDC) was established to support states to better use data and to increase the amount and quality of data available for research related to family self-sufficiency (FSS).  This includes administrative datasets for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food assistance programs, workforce development and training programs, early care and education, and health insurance. This repository is dedicated to sharing public, open-source tools to improve the use of FSS data by program administrators and researchers.

This work is supported by the Family Self-Sufficiency Research Consortium, Grant Number #90PD0272, funded by the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The contents of this repository are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, the Administration for Children and Families, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
