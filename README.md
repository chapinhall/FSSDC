# Family Self-Sufficiency Data Resources
This repository has been created as a way to share resources for program administrators and researchers looking to use data for family 
self-sufficiency research.

About the Family Self-Sufficiency Data Center
----------------------------------------------
The Family Self-Sufficiency Data Center (FSSDC), funded by the U.S. Department of Human Services, provides an empirical, data-driven research platform for 
administrators, policymakers, and researchers to use in answering fundamental policy and program questions. The Data Center has spent the last two years 
working with a small group of pilot states to understand and address the challenges states face using administrative data for research and program administration. 
The Data Center team is now looking to generalize this experience to create resources that can help states more broadly to capitalize on data holdings. In particular, 
the Data Center has the ability to show how agency administrative data can be turned into research-ready datasets (sample data formats to facilitate easy exploration 
and analysis); provide technical assistance including webinars, sample code, and briefs addressing common challenges putting administrative data into data model formats; 
and make publically available code in multiple languages that can be used to run common analyses on data in the data model format.
