## Using Git with GitHub
You may eventually want to consider using Git to take full advantage of using GitHub. Git is the version control system GitHub uses. If you install it locally, you can use version control as you make changes locally and interact with the version of the code online (the remote repository) in your terminal or in a graphical user interface (GUI) you download to work on your desktop.

You should be careful not to upload files to GitHub that you do not intend to be public. You should consider keeping these files outside of your Git folder locally. If you need help removing
information from a repository, contact us and we can help you work on it.

### Using Git within Your Terminal
First, [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Git for your operating system. After installation, you should see several programs available such as *Git Bash*, *Git CMD*, *Git GUI*. The first two are terminal programs that let you use Git from the terminal. *Git Bash* is like a Unix terminal and *Git CMD* is like a Windows terminal. *Git GUI* is a way to use Git locally without using the terminal but by clicking with your mouse instead.

Play around with a [simulated version](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) of using Git with your terminal in your web browser to learn the commands.
