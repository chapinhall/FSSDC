# This set up file directs you to set the specifications of the variables needed for the toolkit 
# analyses, including which variables are for identification, time periods, key for analysis,
# domains or groups to compare, and location-related variables. These variables provide 
# inputs for analyses in the toolkit to assess the accuracy and completeness of key variables 
# as well as the comparability over time and among groups. 
# 
# Longitudinal data files should be set up so that the id and time variables uniquely identify 
# records. That is, there should be no more than one record for each unit/household/family,
# at each time period.
#
# Below, input your dataset description using the following format
# variables:
#    variable_name:
#       classification: See rules below
#       type: See rules below
#    variable_name2:
#    ...

# Notes on Classifications and Types
# Classifications:
# Make sure your classification is id, time, location, key, or domain as described below:
# id: Identification variable (e.g. caseid), for variables that uniquely identify different units
# time: Time variable denoting a period of time (e.g. reporting month)
# key: Most important variables that are focuses of the analysis (e.g. benefit receipt, outcomes)
# domain: Specify different groups of interest for comparison for the research
# location: Location variable describing area of case (zip codes or other geographic indicators)

# Please identify at least one variable for each of id variables, time variables, key variables, 
# and domain variables. Location variables are optional. For a dataset that is 
# cross-sectional, or does not involve a time component, a time variable can be added taking the 
# same value for all records. For example, a user may create a variable titled "time" with the value 
# '1' for all rows.

# Types
# Make sure your type is categorical or numeric as described below:
# Categorical: belong to a discrete category (e.g. "Group_1", "Group_2")
# Numeric: Is of a continuous, numeric nature (e.g. 1, 2, 100.3, 3.5)
